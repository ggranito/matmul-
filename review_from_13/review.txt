What you think they did well (and why)
-Presentation of the work so far is very clear, and you tried to reason about the hardware.
-Itâ€™s good to have both gcc and icc results. Also, you found that j-k-i is the best among different combinations.

What you think they could improve on (and why)
-You could improve the pre-processing of the computation: copy the matrix to have block indexing, or transpose like you mentioned in your report. It should improve the Gflop/s for the medium/high n ranges.

Anything else you would like to add
-Overall it looks pretty good! :D
-Wish we could help more but that's about as far as we got too
