Group 13: Taejoon Song, Marc Aurele Gilles, Gregory Granito 


What you think they did well (and why)
-You seem that have thought this through since your code is very clear and you are getting really good results (at least compared ours).
- Loop ordering yielded good results. Our group couldn’t get this result, though.
- Also, using compiler flag results in good result, which is interesting.
- Overall you seem to be getting very good results! :D

What you think they could improve on (and why)
-You might want to try block indexing? Although we have and our performance is far below yours. But
	it is possible that it'd help further improve your performance.
-It’d be great to include MKL stats on your graphs for us, that was by far the highest performance.

Anything else you would like to add
-Overall this seems like you guys have made good progress.
-Good luck!
